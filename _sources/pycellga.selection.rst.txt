Selection Operators
===============================

The `pycellga.selection` package provides various selection operators that determine how individuals are chosen from the population to act as parents in genetic algorithms. Selection operators play a key role in balancing exploration and exploitation during the optimization process, directly impacting convergence and diversity.


**Tournament Selection**
--------------

Implements a tournament selection method, where a subset of individuals competes, and the best-performing individual is selected as a parent. This method is useful in maintaining diversity and is effective in multimodal optimization landscapes.

**Roulette Wheel Selection**
--------------

Implements a roulette wheel selection mechanism where each individualâ€™s chance of being selected is proportional to its fitness. This method is widely used for its simplicity and is effective in problems where fitness proportionate selection is beneficial.

PYCELLGA Documentation 
====================================

`pycellga`: A Python Package for Improved Cellular Genetic Algorithms

`pycellga` is a Python package that implements cellular genetic algorithms (CGAs) for optimizing 
complex problems. CGAs combine the principles of cellular automata and traditional genetic algorithms, 
utilizing a spatially structured population organized in a grid-like topology. 
This structure allows each individual to interact only with its neighboring individuals, 
promoting diversity and maintaining a balance between exploration and exploitation during the optimization process. 
`pycellga` has machine coded operators with byte implementations. Beside it has Alpha-male CGA, 
Machine Coded Compact CGA and Improved CGA with Machine Coded Operaors for real-valued optimization problems.
